 > Currently studying and building the habit of looking at the big picture rather than focusing on individual pixels.

<h3 align="center" >Favorite Quotes : </h3>

> A positive outlook is critical in all aspects of life, whether professional or personal. As a software engineer, we must cope with uncertainty, be inquisitive, experiment with new ways, and make trade-offs. As a result, we must cultivate a never-say-die attitude toward the tasks at hand. - Utsav <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/utsavized?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BSCcXfDckQ0m6Q70xu07srg%3D%3D"><img align="center" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

> Constant reinvestment of time and money is the route ahead in any endeavor, whether it is business, education, or the stock market.

> Take action and follow your gut instincts rather than becoming mired in analysis paralysis. - man in the mirror aka Imtiaz

> The capacity to be self-aware and understand oneself is one of the most important abilities to develop in our lives.

> Grit and tenacity are extremely important in our lives because if we can get things done, we are all set to be successful. Be a doer and a go-getter, and the rest will take care of itself. Prioritize discipline over motivation. Form is transient, but class is eternal.

> An **educated** person learns from his or her own errors, but a **wise** person learns from the mistakes of others.

> Continue to roll the dice since we can't control the results of our dice rolls, but we can control which dice we roll.

> Things we learn and competencies we acquire that seem utterly unrelated to one another frequently compliment one another.

> Failure is a new chance to start over with fresh thoughts and views.

> Perspective is important since it determines our fate.

> Once we have accomplished what we set out to do, we should turn our attention to self-improvement, namely mental wellness and inner tranquility.

> Intelligence is the ability to learn a model of the world so that we can build an internal model in our heads that represents the structure of everything we know around us. For example, this is a table, that's a coffee cup, and that's a gooseneck lamp etc. - Jeff Hawkins

> Ideas should be introduced through empathic mirroring rather than being taught.

> Passion in what we do will motivate those around us by making an upfront promise while displaying genuine passion about what we are addressing.

> We can't rely on people to merely hand us things. If we want something worthwhile, we must be proactive; else, everyone else will have it.

> Anything is learnable, and nothing is out of reach, if we just sit down, be patient, and start reading from the beginning.

> Things that appear to be too wonderful to be true are almost always true in life.

> We cannot comprehend perception until we consider what each perceptual inference is required for ecologically, as well as the computing difficulties involved in forming that inference.

> "What gets measured, gets controlled, and gets better." - Drucker, Peter

> The quality of our communication is determined by how well we speak and write, as well as how much information we have, how much we practice with that knowledge, and, lastly, by our innate skill.

> Excessive purchases will not make us happy. Contentment is the key to happiness.
