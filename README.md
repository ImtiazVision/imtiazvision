I am a Computer Information Systems graduate with technical exposure in cloud computing, SaaS, Web development, and
microservices framework etc. I am enthusiastic about gaining knowledge, experience, and improving my skills. I believe in lifelong learning. I love learning new frameworks and data structures & algorithm during my free time and being up to date with the latest technologies/trends. When I'm not coding, you'll find me working out, biking, running or spending quality time with family/friends.
